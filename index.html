      <img class="prisonerimage" src="images/prisoner.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Added the solution code in C++ of the question <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/save-the-prisoner/problem">SAVE THE PRISONER from HackerRank</a> </p>
        <p>In this question candies have to be distributed to every prisoner who are seated in a circular manner .The last candy is a sour one. We have to return the prisoner number who gets the sour candy. </p>
        <p>The time complexity involved here is O(1).</p>
        <p>I have also updated the code link in the README.md file </p>

      <img class="doughnutimage" src="images/doughnut.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Added the solution code in java of the question <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/candies/problem">CANDIES from HackerRank</a></p>
        <p>In this question Alice wants to give candies to her children. Every children has a rating. Each child should get atleast one candy and if two are sitting together the one with higher rating should get more number of candies. Minimizing the
          number of candies required, we have to return the total candies required. </p>
        <p>The time complexity involved here is O(n)</p>
        <p>I have also updated the code link in the README.md file </p>

      <h2>MY THOUGHTS</h2>
      <p class="para">My experience contributing in Kharagpur Winter of Code has been quite good. Although I couldnt contribute much but still learnt a lot of new things.I also learnt the mannerism of communicating with mentors and all the people associated with
        this.</p>
